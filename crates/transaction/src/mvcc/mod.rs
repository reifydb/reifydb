//! This module implements MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), a widely
//! used method for ACID transactions and concurrency control. It allows
//! multiple concurrent transactions to access and modify the same dataset,
//! isolates them from each other, detects and handles conflicts, and commits
//! their writes atomically as a single unit. It uses an underlying storage
//! engine to store raw keys and values.
//!
//! VERSIONS
//! ========
//!
//! MVCC handles concurrency control by managing multiple historical versions of
//! keys, identified by a timestamp. Every write adds a new version at a higher
//! timestamp, with deletes having a special tombstone value. For example, the
//! keys a,b,c,d may have the following values at various logical timestamps (x
//! is tombstone):
//!
//! Time
//! 5
//! 4  a4
//! 3      b3      x
//! 2
//! 1  a1      c1  d1
//!    a   b   c   d   Keys
//!
//! A transaction t2 that started at T=2 will see the values a=a1, c=c1, d=d1. A
//! different transaction t5 running at T=5 will see a=a4, b=b3, c=c1.
//!
//! toyDB uses logical timestamps with a sequence number stored in
//! Key::NextVersion. Each new read-write transaction takes its timestamp from
//! the current value of Key::NextVersion and then increments the value for the
//! next transaction.
//!
//! ISOLATION
//! =========
//!
//! MVCC provides an isolation level called snapshot isolation. Briefly,
//! transactions see a consistent snapshot of the database state as of their
//! start time. Writes made by concurrent or subsequent transactions are never
//! visible to it. If two concurrent transactions write to the same key they
//! will conflict and one of them must retry. A transaction's writes become
//! atomically visible to subsequent transactions only when they commit, and are
//! rolled back on failure. Read-only transactions never conflict with other
//! transactions.
//!
//! Transactions write new versions at their timestamp, storing them as
//! Key::Version(key, version) => value. If a transaction writes to a key and
//! finds a newer version, it returns an error and the client must retry.
//!
//! Active (uncommitted) read-write transactions record their version in the
//! active set, stored as Key::Active(version). When new transactions begin, they
//! take a snapshot of this active set, and any key versions that belong to a
//! transaction in the active set are considered invisible (to anyone except that
//! transaction itself). Writes to keys that already have a past version in the
//! active set will also return an error.
//!
//! To commit, a transaction simply deletes its record in the active set. This
//! will immediately (and, crucially, atomically) make all of its writes visible
//! to subsequent transactions, but not ongoing ones. If the transaction is
//! cancelled and rolled back, it maintains a record of all keys it wrote as
//! Key::TxWrite(version, key), so that it can find the corresponding versions
//! and delete them before removing itself from the active set.
//!
//! Consider the following example, where we have two ongoing transactions at
//! time T=2 and T=5, with some writes that are not yet committed marked in
//! parentheses.
//!
//! Active set: [2, 5]
//!
//! Time
//! 5 (a5)
//! 4  a4
//! 3      b3      x
//! 2         (x)     (e2)
//! 1  a1      c1  d1
//!    a   b   c   d   e   Keys
//!
//! Here, t2 will see a=a1, d=d1, e=e2 (it sees its own writes). t5 will see
//! a=a5, b=b3, c=c1. t2 does not see any newer versions, and t5 does not see
//! the tombstone at c@2 nor the value e=e2, because version=2 is in its active
//! set.
//!
//! If t2 tries to write b=b2, it receives an error and must retry, because a
//! newer version exists. Similarly, if t5 tries to write e=e5, it receives an
//! error and must retry, because the version e=e2 is in its active set.
//!
//! To commit, t2 can remove itself from the active set. A new transaction t6
//! starting after the commit will then see c as deleted and e=e2. t5 will still
//! not see any of t2's writes, because it's still in its local snapshot of the
//! active set at the time it began.
//!
//! READ-ONLY AND TIME TRAVEL QUERIES
//! =================================
//!
//! Since MVCC stores historical versions, it can trivially support time travel
//! queries where a transaction reads at a past timestamp and has a consistent
//! view of the database at that time.
//!
//! This is done by a transaction simply using a past version, as if it had
//! started far in the past, ignoring newer versions like any other transaction.
//! This transaction cannot write, as it does not have a unique timestamp (the
//! original read-write transaction originally owned this timestamp).
//!
//! The only wrinkle is that the time-travel query must also know what the active
//! set was at that version. Otherwise, it may see past transactions that committed
//! after that time, which were not visible to the original transaction that wrote
//! at that version. Similarly, if a time-travel query reads at a version that is
//! still active, it should not see its in-progress writes, and after it commits
//! a different time-travel query should not see those writes either, to maintain
//! version consistency.
//!
//! To achieve this, every read-write transaction stores its active set snapshot
//! in the storage engine as well, as Key::TxActiveSnapshot, such that later
//! time-travel queries can restore its original snapshot. Furthermore, a
//! time-travel query can only see versions below the snapshot version, otherwise
//! it could see spurious in-progress or since-committed versions.
//!
//! In the following example, a time-travel query at version=3 would see a=a1,
//! c=c1, d=d1.
//!
//! Time
//! 5
//! 4  a4
//! 3      b3      x
//! 2
//! 1  a1      c1  d1
//!    a   b   c   d   Keys
//!
//! Read-only queries work similarly to time-travel queries, with one exception:
//! they read at the next (current) version, i.e. Key::NextVersion, and use the
//! current active set, storing the snapshot in memory only. Read-only queries
//! do not increment the version sequence number in Key::NextVersion.
//!
