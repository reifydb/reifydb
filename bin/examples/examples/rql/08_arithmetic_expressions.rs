//! # Arithmetic Expressions Example
//!
//! Demonstrates arithmetic operations in ReifyDB's RQL:
//! - Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
//! - Modulo operator (%)
//! - Parentheses for operation precedence
//! - Arithmetic in different contexts
//!
//! Run with: `make rql-arithmetic` or `cargo run --bin rql-arithmetic`
