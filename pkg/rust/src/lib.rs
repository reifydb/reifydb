//! # ReifyDB
//!
//! ReifyDB is an embeddable application backend engine that blends a high-level query language
//! (RQL â€“ Reify Query Language) with a low-level key-value storage system.
//!
//! It is designed for rapid prototyping, persistent data manipulation, and embedding powerful
//! logic directly into your app â€” without the need for a traditional database server.
//!
//! The system is composed of several submodules:
//!
//! - [`encoding`]: Handles serialization and deserialization of data types.
//! - [`rql`]: The high-level query language layer, responsible for parsing, planning, optimizing, and executing queries.
//! - [`storage`]: The underlying key-value store responsible for persistence and data access.
//!
//! ReifyDB aims to be minimal, developer-first, and flexible enough to power backends, embedded analytics, and local-first systems.
//!
//! See also: [`testscript`] for running integration-style script tests.
